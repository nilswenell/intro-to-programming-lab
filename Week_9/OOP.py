# OOP: Object Oriented Programming
# every data object is an item in python.

# classes describe what an object looks like.
# example: int. the number 3 would be an instance of the 'int' class.
# one of the things this class can do is undergo operations.

x = 3 # x is an instance of an int
x = x + 3 # this int did an operation by adding 3
#     ^ this '+' is an alias for x.__add__(3) or something.
